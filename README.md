Mute for Espresso
=================

This is a dark, muted color scheme for Espresso. I created it to be visually soft and easy on the eyes, while maintaining ease of distinction and syntax clarity. Currently it only supports HTML and CSS, mostly. Eventually, I will add in support for PHP and JS as well.

To add this theme to Espresso, simply copy Mute.css to ~/Library/Application Support/Espresso/Themes/ on your mac. If Espresso was open, restart and Mute should be available in the theme selection.
