Espresso Theme - Mute
=================

This is a dark, muted color scheme for <a href="http://macrabbit.com/espresso/" target="_blank">Espresso</a>. I created it to be soft on the eyes and visually pleasing to look at, while maintaining syntax clarity and relationships.

Currently it only supports HTML and CSS. Eventually, I will add in support for PHP and JS as well.

To add this theme to Espresso, simply copy Mute.css to ~/Library/Application Support/Espresso/Themes/ on your mac. If Espresso was open, restart and Mute should be available in the theme selection.
